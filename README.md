cyttools is an open source pipeline framework for the analysis of high parameter cytometry data. It was presented as a poster at ABRF 2017 and CYTO 2017 and won outstanding posters awards at both conferences. It is currently under active development and being alpha tested at UVA. Code should be all available by end of July.
